This repository contains some Eclipse file for configuration. 

### Templates

The 'templates' folder contains all my favorites templates. The content is hierarchically organized.

The 'mechanic' folder contains all my favorites preferences in [Workspace Mechanic](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/) Format. I invite you to discover this plugin. It allows you to easily manage your user preferences. More when creating a new workspace, the plugin prompts you to update your environment.
